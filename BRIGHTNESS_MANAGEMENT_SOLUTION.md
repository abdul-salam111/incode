# Brightness Management Solution

## Problem
Some brightness control plugins (like `screen_brightness`) use app-level brightness overrides which can interfere with the system brightness control — especially on Android. When brightness is set programmatically and the override persists beyond the app's lifecycle, the system brightness control becomes disabled or ignored.

## Solution (Permanent Fix)

### ✅ Step 1: Save and Restore Properly
- **Save brightness only once** when entering the scanner screen
- **Reset brightness on dispose** to restore original value
- **Reset brightness mode to system** (Android only)

### ✅ Step 2: Android Platform Channel Implementation
The solution uses a platform channel to force brightness to return to system-controlled mode on Android.

#### Flutter Code (Implemented in controllers):
```dart
static const platform = MethodChannel('com.example.brightness');

Future<void> resetBrightnessToSystem() async {
  try {
    if (Platform.isAndroid) {
      await platform.invokeMethod('resetBrightnessMode');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    print("Failed to reset brightness mode: $e");
  }
}
```

#### Android Code (Implemented in MainActivity.kt):
```kotlin
MethodChannel(flutterEngine.dartExecutor.binaryMessenger, CHANNEL).setMethodCallHandler { call, result ->
    when (call.method) {
        "resetBrightnessMode" -> {
            try {
                val contentResolver = applicationContext.contentResolver
                Settings.System.putInt(
                    contentResolver,
                    Settings.System.SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_MODE,
                    Settings.System.SCREEN_BRIGHTNESS_MODE_AUTOMATIC
                )
                result.success(true)
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                result.error("FAILED", "Could not reset brightness mode", null)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ Step 3: Implementation Details

#### Controllers Updated:
1. **QRCodeController** (`lib/controllers/scan_controller.dart`)
2. **UtilitiScreenController** (`lib/controllers/utiliti_screen_controller.dart`)

#### Key Features:
- **Prevents duplicate brightness saves** with `_brightnessSaved` flag
- **Proper lifecycle management** with `onClose()` method
- **System mode reset** for Android devices
- **Error handling** for all brightness operations

#### Flow:
1. **When entering scanner:**
   - Save current brightness (only once)
   - Increase brightness for better scanning

2. **When exiting scanner:**
   - Restore previous brightness
   - Reset brightness mode to system (Android)
   - Clear torch if active

### ✅ Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Use the scanner and toggle brightness/torch
2. Exit the app completely
3. Check that system brightness controls work normally
4. Use `adb shell dumpsys power | grep -i brightness` to verify brightness mode

### ✅ Files Modified:
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/in_code/MainActivity.kt`
- `lib/controllers/scan_controller.dart`
- `lib/controllers/utiliti_screen_controller.dart`

This solution ensures that brightness controls never get stuck and system brightness management continues to work normally after using the scanner.
